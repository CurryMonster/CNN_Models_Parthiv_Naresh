# Building with Convolutional Neural Networks

This is the beginning of a series of projects working with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Prerequisites

* Python 3
* Tensorflow >= 1.10
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib

## Package Installer & IDE

~~I'd recommend using Anaconda as a package manager and the accompanying Spyder IDE.
I prefer Anaconda because of the ease with which you can set up environments to keep
package installations separate, but obviously you can use anything you like.~~

Working over a notebook is a cleaner way of approaching simpler machine learning problems.
Using Google Colab makes it more straightforward to mount data over Drive and then import it for training/validationt/testing.

## Project 1 - Animal Classifier

This project is an animal image classification problem.

I'm using this dataset consisting of 13,000 animal images across 30 categories to train/test with, and 6,000 images to predict using the trained model:
